# What is this?
Basic experimentation to get a native LAZ file decoder to work in native Javascript.

# Why?
The emscripten compilation of the LASzip library was unusably slow.

# License
The code is heavily based on the LASzip library (some code is actually copy-pasted and made javascript compatible), so the same license as LASzip applies.

LGPL.
